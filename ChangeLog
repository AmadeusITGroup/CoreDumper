	* coredumper: initial release:
	  The coredumper utility allows a running program to generate a
	  core file without actually crashing.  This serves to allow the
	  programmer to generate a snapshot of a running program's state
	  at any time.

	* coredumper: version 0.2 release
	* fixed compilation on icc (simonb)
	* added a new WriteCoreDumpLimited() function that allows the
	  caller to specify the maximum core file size. This is needed to
	  emulate "ulimit -c". (markus)

	* coredumper: version 0.3 release
	* reorganized the source to make porting and reuse easier.
	* ported to ARM.
	* core files can now be compressed on-the-fly.
	* added support for recent 2.6.x kernels, which subtly changed the
	ptrace() API. It used to be possible to PTRACE_ATTACH to threads
	in the same process, but newer kernels require making this call
	from a separate process. This change is backwards compatible.
	* improved compatibility with more (historic) versions of both
	libc and of the Linux kernel.
	* the convenience methods now enforce more restrictive file
	permissions when writing to disk. The caller no longer needs to
	adjust the umask() to make file writing secure.
	* the coredumper fails gracefully if called when the stack is almost
	about to overflow.
	* fixed bugs that prevented thread listing on 64bit machines.
	* switched to different syscall() functions in order to better
	preserve the call stack. Added work-around for broken libc
	system headers.
	* all assembly code is position-independent.
	* the unittest can now be run even if the systems locale is not
	English.

	* fixed some packaging problems with newer versions of RPM
	* added assembly version of sys_clone() in order to work around
	buggy implementations in glibc.

	* coredumper: version 1.0 release
	* made devel RPMs depend on the runtime-only package.
	* fixed signal related system calls on x86_64.
	* wrote manual pages.
